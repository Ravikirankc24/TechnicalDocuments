            <p class="- topic/p p">Although the most common types of viral hepatitis are HAV, HBV and HCV, some
                clinicians had previously considered the acute and chronic phases of hepatic
                infections as "types" of viral hepatitis. HAV was considered to be acute viral
                hepatitis because the HAV infections seldom caused permanent liver damage that led
                to hepatic (liver) failure. HBV and HCV produced chronic viral hepatitis. However,
                these terms are outdated and not currently used as frequently because all of the
                viruses that cause hepatitis may have acute phase symptoms (see symptoms below).
                Prevention techniques and vaccinations have markedly reduced the current incidence
                of common viral hepatitis infections; however, there remains a population of about 1
                to 2 million people in the U.S. with chronic HBV, and about 3.5 million with chronic
                HCV according to the CDC. Statistics are incomplete for determining how many new
                infections occur each year; the CDC documented infections but then goes on to
                estimate the actual numbers by further estimating the number of unreported
                infections (see following sections and reference 1).</p>

                <p class="- topic/p p">In 2016, there were 2,007 new HAV cases reported to the CDC. The hepatitis caused
                    by HAV is an acute illness (acute viral hepatitis) that never becomes chronic.
                    At one time, hepatitis A was referred to as "infectious hepatitis" because it
                    could be spread easily from person to person like other viral infections.
                    Infection with hepatitis A virus can be spread through the ingestion of food or
                    water, especially where unsanitary conditions allow water or food to become
                    contaminated by human waste containing hepatitis A (the fecal-oral mode of
                    transmission). Hepatitis A typically is spread among household members and close
                    contacts through the passage of oral secretions (intimate kissing) or stool
                    (poor hand washing). It also is common to have infection spread to customers in
                    restaurants and among children and workers in day care centers if hand washing
                    and sanitary precautions are not observed.</p>

                <p class="- topic/p p">There were 3,218 new cases of HBV infection estimated by the CDC in 2016 and more
                    than 1,698 people died due to the consequences of chronic hepatitis B infection
                    in the United States according to the CDC. HBV hepatitis was at one time
                    referred to as "serum hepatitis," because it was thought that the only way HBV
                    could spread was through blood or serum (the liquid portion of blood) containing
                    the virus. It is now known that HBV can spread by sexual contact, the transfer
                    of blood or serum through shared needles in drug abusers, accidental needle
                    sticks with needles contaminated with infected blood, blood transfusions,
                    hemodialysis, and by infected mothers to their newborns. The infection also can
                    be spread by tattooing, body piercing, and sharing razors and toothbrushes (if
                    there is contamination with infected blood). About 5% to 10% of patients with
                    HBV hepatitis develop chronic HBV infection (infection lasting at least six
                    months and often years to decades) and can infect others as long as they remain
                    infected. Patients with chronic HBV infection also are at risk of developing
                    cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. It is estimated that there are 2.2
                    million people in the U.S. and 2 billion people worldwide who suffer with
                    chronic HBV infections.</p>

                <p class="- topic/p p">The CDC reported that there were 2,967 reported new cases of hepatitis C in 2016.
                    The CDC reports that the actual number of acute cases are estimated to be 13.9
                    times the number of reported cases in any year, thus, it is estimated that there
                    were actually 41,200 acute hepatitis C cases occurring in 2016. HCV hepatitis
                    was previously referred to as "non-A, non-B hepatitis," because the causative
                    virus had not been identified, but it was known to be neither HAV nor HBV. HCV
                    usually is spread by shared needles among drug abusers, blood transfusion,
                    hemodialysis, and needle sticks. Approximately 75%-90% of transfusion-associated
                    hepatitis is caused by HCV. Transmission of the virus by sexual contact has been
                    reported, but is considered rare. An estimated 75% to 85% of patients with acute
                    HCV infection develop chronic infection. Patients with chronic HCV infection can
                    continue to infect others. Patients with chronic HCV infection are at risk for
                    developing cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. It is estimated that
                    there are about 3.5 million people with chronic HCV infection in the U.S.</p>

                <p class="- topic/p p">There also are viral hepatitis types D, E, and G. The most important of these at
                    present is the hepatitis D virus (HDV), also known as the delta virus or agent.
                    It is a small virus that requires concomitant infection with HBV to survive. HDV
                    cannot survive on its own because it requires a protein that the HBV makes (the
                    envelope protein, also called surface antigen) to enable it to infect liver
                    cells. The ways in which HDV is spread are by shared needles among drug abusers,
                    contaminated blood, and by sexual contact; essentially the same ways as HBV.</p>
                <p class="- topic/p p">Individuals who already have chronic HBV infection can acquire HDV infection at
                    the same time as they acquire the HBV infection, or at a later time. Those with
                    chronic hepatitis due to HBV and HDV develop cirrhosis (severe liver scarring)
                    rapidly. Moreover, the combination of HDV and HBV virus infection is very
                    difficult to treat.</p>
                <p class="- topic/p p"><strong class="+ topic/ph hi-d/b ph b">Hepatitis E </strong>virus (HEV) is similar to HAV in terms of disease, and mainly
